# Monocula-Depth-Perception

Monocular depth perception refers to the ability to estimate depth and distance from a single image captured by a monocular camera. This algorithm leverages advancements in computer vision and deep learning to predict the spatial depth of objects in a scene without requiring stereo cameras or LiDAR sensors.

Key Features of the Algorithm:

Input: A single RGB image captured from a monocular camera.
Output: A dense depth map, where each pixel in the input image corresponds to a depth value in the output.
Architecture: Typically based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or transformer-based models to extract spatial and semantic features from the image.
Loss Function: Often uses a combination of supervised loss (e.g., Mean Squared Error between predicted and ground-truth depth) and unsupervised loss (e.g., photometric consistency in stereo pairs or sequences).
Key Components:

Feature Extraction: Extracts high-level features from the image using convolutional layers.
Depth Estimation Head: A regression network predicts continuous depth values.
Multi-scale Predictions: Some models generate depth maps at multiple resolutions to improve accuracy and detail.
Post-processing: Includes refinement techniques to enhance the resolution and remove artifacts.
Applications:

Autonomous Driving: Helps vehicles perceive their environment for navigation and obstacle avoidance.
Robotics: Assists robots in understanding their surroundings and planning movements.
AR/VR: Enhances realism by integrating accurate depth information into virtual environments.
Medical Imaging: Used to infer depth in endoscopy and other single-view medical imaging modalities.
